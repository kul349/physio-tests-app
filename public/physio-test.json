The therapist will flex the patient's elbow to 90 degrees and abducts the patient's shoulder to 90 degrees in sagittal plane and 180 degrees in frontal plane (horizontal abduction), maintaining neutral rotation. The examiner then slowly applies an external rotation force to the arm to 90 degrees while carefully monitoring the patient. Patient apprehension from this maneuver, not pain, is considered a positive test. Pain with the maneuver, but not apprehension may indicate a pathology other than instability, such as posterior impingement of the rotator cuff.",

The examiner then pulls the distal part of the humerus in a caudal direction. However, the sitting position with arms by the side is considered to provide more reliable results as suggested by McFarland et al. The test is considered positive when the appearance of sulcus in the subacromial space is more than 1cm as the humeral head translates in the inferior direction.To enhance the diagnostic accuracy, the test should be performed twice, first with the arm in neutral rotation and second with the arm in external rotation. Inferior translation should be the same in both positions. An increased degree of inferior translation with the arm in external rotation suggests a potential lesion of the rotator interval.",
